# GradCafe Survey Visualizer

I'm not affiliated with GradCafe.

All this does is, it takes your search results and returns a few visualizations of GRE scores & uGPA scores.

For large searches, I placed a 2-second delay between page queries.

I use this [GRE Conversion Table](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/concordance_information.pdf) to convert scores on the old scale to the new scale.
